Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This portfolio is a showcase of my skills and expertise in working with Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and analyze data. I am proficient in creating and modifying tables, querying data from databases, manipulating data, and producing meaningful insights. This portfolio includes examples of projects I have completed, such as data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization, as well as any relevant certifications or courses I have completed. I am passionate about using SQL to derive insights from data and make data-driven decisions. I hope this portfolio demonstrates my ability to effectively use SQL to manage and analyze data, and I am excited to share my skills with potential employers and collaborators.
